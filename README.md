# To Do App
This simple toDoApp can help to keep your daily life or office life organized. With login, logout, register the user sees only his/her tasks, and only he/she can see them. Tasks are organized in a title list with completed tasks at the bottom. After logged in, the user can search for specific tasks, or create new tasks, read the description of about one specific task, update, and delete their tasks. At admin backstage the superuser can edit information about groups and users.

Here is the live version of my project.
